Hey!

This is my repo for my Unity projects and C# code.
Don't judge me please when it comes to art/color design :P

If you have any questions, please let me know: fatyga.karol@gmail.com

1. Number Wizard - a game with simple logic, guessing your number from 1 - 1000
2. Hundred Tower - CYOA or Choose Your Own Adventure game, a short mockup of games' logic and choice design; WebGL build
3. RPG - scripts for my simple/unfinished RPG
4. [Prototype of a beat mechanic](https://karolef.github.io/Unity/ProtoBeatMechanic/) - to display how hard it is to tap a key in a 5 frame window
