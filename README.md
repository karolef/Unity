Hey!

This is my repo for my Unity projects and C# code.
Don't judge me please when it comes to art/color design :P

If you have any questions, please let me know: fatyga.karol@gmail.com

1. Number Wizard - a game with simple logic, guessing your number from 1 - 1000
2. [Hundred Tower](https://karolef.github.io/Unity/Hundred%20Tower/) - CYOA or Choose Your Own Adventure game, a short mockup of games' logic and choice design; WebGL build
3. RPG - scripts for my simple/unfinished RPG
4. [Prototype of a beat mechanic](https://karolef.github.io/Unity/ProtoBeatMechanic/) - to display how hard it is to tap a key in a 5 frame window
5. Brick Breaker prototype - simple mechanics of the classic game brick breaker replicated
6. [TileVania](https://karolef.github.io/Unity/TileVania/) - simple platformer with only 2 levels with not a lot of polish; WebGL build
7. Westival Prototype v 0.1 - simple player & camera movement, beat system - doesn't work too well as a WebGL build, lesson learned
